					The Hajee Karutha Rowther Howdia College was established in the year 1956 by the Late Hajee Mohamed Meeran Rowther, popularly known as Hajee Karutha Rowther.

					Hajee Karutha Rowther Howdia College, occupies a unique place among the institutions of higher education in Tamil Nadu. It owes its existence solely to the munificence of Hajee Karutha Rowther, who was a man of simple living but lofty ideals. The college provides opportunity especially to the poor students who could not afford to continue their studies in cities like Madurai, Tiruchi and Chennai. Hajee Karutha Rowther Howdia College claims the reputation of the first rural college ever established in the erstwhile Madurai district.

					The Institution, Hajee Karutha Rowther Howdia College, has fulfilled the dreams of its founder by being accredited with the most coveted ‘A’ Grade by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) in the year 2005. The “BEST COLLEGE AWARD FOR COMMUNAL HARMONY” at the University level was conferred upon the College in 2005 by Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai. The college was conferred with Autonomous status by the UGC, from the Academic year 2013-2014 and was Re-Accredited with “A++ ” Grade by NAAC (3 Cycle) in 2022.

					Having celebrated the Diamond Jubilee year (1956-2016), the College stepped into its 65th year of service to the people of this region.

					This institution has every right to be proud of having sent out many talented young men and women to serve the nation and society. We can very well hope that, it will continue doing better service in the years to come.
